							Networking

				

						Introduction to Networking




Network: A Network is a group of devices connected to each other allowing them to share information and resources.

LAN: Local Area Network. (Connects Devices in a home together for example)

WAN: Wide Area Network. (Connects large areas together. The Largest WAN is the internet)

						Importance of Networks
- Enables communication between devices. 
- Facilities sharing of files, printers and more
- Critical for browsing, streaming and communication.
- Backbone for app connectivity. 

(When you use an app, your device sends data to a server over a network. Server processes the data and sends back response)

						Networking in DevOps

Server Interaction: Enables communication between servers and applications
Deployment: Critical for launching, updating and managing applications
Management: Enables Monitoring and Managing of Infrastructure
Optimisation: Enhance performance by ensuring data flows smoothly between devices and servers.


						Key Networking Components

- Switches: Connects multiple devices within the same network. Manages data flow within a LAN
- Router: Direct traffic between different networks. Connects Networks. (Home network - Internet)
- Firewalls: Monitors and controlls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on pre-determined security rules.


						IP addressing

- Unique Identifer for each device on network. Allows devices to locate, Identify and communicate with one another.

				Ipv4					Ipv6
- Most common						- 128 bit numbers. eight groups of four hexadecimal digits.
- ex: 192.168.0.5 (32-bit numbers) (numbers < 255)	- Much larger pool of unique adresses
- Ipv4 addresses becoming scarce (internet growing)	- Improved security features
							- Simplified adress assignment

						MAC Addresses
MAC: Media Access Control Address
- Unique ID assigned to network interface
- Each device on network has own unique MAC address
- 48-bit address ex: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
- Operate at the data link layer of the OSI model. ?????
- Help Devices ID each other on the local network.
- Play a critical role in network communication and security. 
- Crucial for making sure devices connect to the correct network


						Ports and Protocols: TCP,UDP

Ports: Doors on Device. Each door is numbered. Each number is used for specific type of network communication
	Port 80: Word traffic (HTTP)
	Port 443: (HTTPS)
Ports: Help facilitate communication between devices and make sure data goes to the right place. 

Protocols: Rules of road for data transmission. HTTP, FTP, SNTP.
	   Ensures Devices can communicate effectively by following the same set of rules. (Like Languages)

						So

Ports Ensure data gets to right application on your device and Protocosl ensure Devices can understand each other
										(Using same rule set)


					The 2 Main protocols. TCP and UDP



					Transmission control protocol (TCP)

TCP: A fundemental Protocol. 

TCP is the postman of the internet. Ensures data from one devices reaches another device accurately and in correct order.

Characteristics: 
- Connection Oriented. Before data is sent, connection is established
- Requires "Handshake". 
- Reliable data transfer. (Ensures all data sent is recieved correctly. If data lost/corrupted, TCP will resend)
- Error Checking

Functions (usecases):
- Ensures data is delivered in order
- controls flow of data to prevent congestion and ensure smooth error free communication
- Bidirectional communication: When devices need to exchange data back and forth. (web browsing, email...)
- Essential for any application where reliable delivery of data is essential. 


						User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

UDP is a simple protocol used to send and recieve data

Characteristics: 
- Connectionless (No formal connection established between sender and reciever. Each packet sent independently)
- Simple protocol to send and recieve data
- no prior communication needed. Benefits: Data sent immedietely. Drawbacks: No Gaurantee data will reach destination
- Fast but less reliable

Functions (Usecases):
- Suitable for real-time applications (ex: Video Streaming, Gaming) Speed more important than reliability.
- DNS (Anything DNS related uses UDP behind the scenes)
- VPN (VPN uses DNS because faster and works better for streaming applications)


					
							OSI Model

The OSI model is a conceptual framework explaining how data travels through a network, divided into 7 layers. from physical hardware up to the applications you use.
