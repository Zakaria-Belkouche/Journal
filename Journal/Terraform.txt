							TERRAFORM



							Introduction

- The go to software for IAC. Allows you to deploy infrastructure on AWS using Code. 

- IAC Benefits: Easy to adjust, Easy to replicate, Easy to scale, Easier to see in it's totality. 

- Terraform is a Infrastructure Orchestration tool. Ansible is a config management tool. 

- Terraform is a cloud Agnostic too. It can deploy infrastructure to: AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform.

- Terraform can also deploy Kubernetes resources. Point is, Terraform can deploy to many different resources.

- It does this through the terriform registry where it will use plugins and api calls to deploy to different providers.


						IaC with Version control (git)
 

- IAC can be stored in git. This allows you to track changes, roll back commits, and collabarate amongst team members.

- Terraform State file and Terraform lock file keep the IAC stable while teams are working on it. Not sure how yet. 


					Infra Orchestration vs Config Management



			Infra Orchestration					Config Management


- Tools: CloudFormation , Terraform				- Tools: chef , Ansible , puppet
- Arranging the essentials in a particular order		- Consider what runs inside the machine.
- Used for overall deployment of infrastructure			- Configure the infra to run app code.  
- Describes the infrastructre state. (What you want)		- Install software, manage files, ensure services run. 
- Declarative (I want this. Terraform figures out how to do it) - eg: Install Nginx, setup permissions, config firewalls




						The terraform WorkFlow


	Practioner -> Infrastructure as code ---> Plan  ---------------> Run an 'Apply' ----> Deployed on Cloud

	   (Me)		(Writes code)	  (Terraform plan command)     (Apply the IAC plan)





						Tips for using Terraform


- Use the official Terraform Documentation. 
- Terraform registry - Used daily when using terraform and deploying. This includes documentation for AWS provider.
- Testing and Validation - (You don't want to break/delete important live code. So important to test and validate)
- Start with a small MVP (Minimum Viable Product) then iterate. Configure resource you need to deploy then add on to it.
- Implement Dry Software engineering Principle. (Do not repeat yourself. Use modules. Make as dry as possible)





						Terraform State File


- The state file is very important.
- The terraform state file is the blueprint. It is a record of your current existing infrastructure.
- The terraform state file ensures idompotency. Idompotency:
  (Terraform config will always produce the same result). If changes are made to state file config, it doesn't
  completely change everything, it just applies particular change.

When you run terraform apply, terraform checks your code, what currently exists, the differences (if any)
and if there is no differences, then no changes are made. This is what we call idompotency. Always getting the same
result unless something has actually changed in the code. 

This means that it is safe to re-apply your infrastructure. Reduces risk of recreating things. Keeps infra stable. 
Works well in CI/CD pipelines.

Terraform plan shows ONLY what will change.



						Desired vs Current State


- .tf			> Desired State (Your terraform config. Maybe changes you are trying to implement)
- .tfstate		> Current State (The state file)  


						The Backend

- This is where terraform stores your state file. It can be located on local device or can direct to a shared S3 bucket.




						Terraform Commands:

terraform init		- Sets up work place. (Terraform block and provider block. Installs libaries/aws log in)
terraform plan		- preview changes terraform will make before they happen. See into the future.  
			  Everything shown in plan refers to changes! Symbols: (+ create) (~ update) (- destroy)
terraform apply		- Takes execution plan and applies it to infrastructure.
			  Will generate execution plan and wait for confirmation from you before performing actions.
terraform destroy	- Safely and Efficiently tears down infrastructure managed by particular .tf config.
			  Reads current config and state file to understand what it's managing. Then generates destroy
			  plan. Can specify which sources to destroy. Will also wait for confirmation. 
			  Terraform then updates state file to confirm resources have been destroyed. 




						Terraform Providers

- Just simply a plugin that allows you to interact with cloud platforms and enables terraform to manage cloud resources.

				---------------------------------------------------------------

						Terraform Provider Code Block

Terraform { required_providers { ... } }			>  This is the Terraform Provider block. Example below.


Terraform {
     required_providers {
	aws = {
	  source = "hashicorp/aws"				> The libary of code that knows how to interact with aws
	  version = "5.62.0"
	}
     }
  }

Provider "aws" {
	#Configuration options		>	To login to your aws basically. can use ~/.aws/credentials
  }


				-----------------------------------------------------------------

				

							Resource Block

- Used to define a piece of infrastructure that you want to manage.
- Each resource block corresponds to specific resource type. 


				-----------------------------------------------------------------

						EC2 resource block


resource "aws_instance" "name" {				# Specify which resource and it's name. 
  ami = "xyz" 							# Amazon Machine image. Template for instance
  instance_type = "t2.micro"					# Self Explanatory. 
Tags = {							# A way to label/categorise resources. Not compulsory
Name = "Bugfix"							  But good practice. Tags include: Name, team, owner etc
}
}

						Terraform Importing


- If a resource already exists in cloud environment but not created with terraform. What do we do? Terraform import.
- Terraform brings existing resources under terraform's management. 


- We use an 'import block' to import instances using the id. 
- Terraform docs guide us on exactly how to do this.
- Very simple... Look code below.
- you can run this directly from the terminal or make a tf file, plan, apply, then delete it once done.
- Oh by the way, you need to manually add the resource into ur actual.tf file so it knows where it's important 'to'. 

				-----------------------------------------------------------------

import {
  to = aws_instance.web
  id = "i-xyz123"
}

				-----------------------------------------------------------------

- Check if the terraform import works by running a terraform plan. Check if everything matches.
