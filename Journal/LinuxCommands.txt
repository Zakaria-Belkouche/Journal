ls: Lists all files in a directory

-a > including hidden files
-l > all details
-1 > spaced out by lines
-R > Recrusively



cd: Change Directory

.. > Moves back 
~ > home directory
. > root directory



find: Find stuff

- size   n[bckw...] (units)
- name   (Specific name)
- type   (d, f)
- perm   (match permissions 644)
- user	 (files owned by user)
- group  (files belonging to group)
- exec   (Run command on each file) [find . -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \;]  > this will find files and remove them
{} > place holder for 'file'. '\;' > ends the command
- empty  (find empty files or dirs)



grep: looks through text files and shows all lines that contain a word.

grep "word" file
-i  > case insensitive search
-r  > recrusievely search through all files in current dir
-v  > Opposite. Show lines that don't match the "word"


uniq: report or omit repeated lines THAT ARE CONSECUTIVE

-c > prefix lines with no. of occurances
-u > only print unique lines



sort: sorts lines of text files


strings: collects only the human readible lines with at least 4 (unless otherwise specified) human readible consecutive characters.

-n   > readible at least n characters long



base64   > Base 64 enocdes data which may contain any character into easily readible letters.

echo 'xyz' | base 64
-d     > (Decodes) 
-i     > ignore non alphabet




tr   > Translate. It replaces set of characters with another set

example:  tr 'A-Za-z' 'B-ZAb-za'  > Rotates all letters, uppercase and lowercase 1 to the right. 




cp   > Copy.

cp [SOURCE] [DEST]
-t    > copy all sources into directory



mv  > Move/Rename a file

if destination is a new filename it will rename. If dest is directory, it will move. 



Compression/Decompression/HexDumps

Hexdump > Binary code in a human readable files

Compression: Different types of Compressions.

CompressionType		Extension	Optimized For				Decompress With
gzip			.gz		Speed + decent compression		gunzip or gzip -d
bzip2			.bz2		Better compression (slower)		bunzip2
xz			.xz		Maximum compression (very slow)		unxz
zip			.zip		Cross-platform, common on Windows	unzip
tar			.tar		Bundling files (not compressed!)	tar -xf
tar.gz			.tar.gz		Bundle + gzip				tar -xzf

tar extracts out of (zip folder) and unpacks. x > extract   f > file ... 	Hence: 		tar-xf

Reminder: Files must end in appropriate extension in order to decompress.



file [name]   >  State file type. Useful for understanding how to decompress!




ssh   > Securely connect and manage remote computes with a Linux OS. 

-i   > identity file (ssh address file)
-l   > User to login by 
-p   > Port to connect to



nc   > similar to ssh but instead of full connection, allows to send/recieve raw data to specified host and port

nc [host] [port]




openssl    > SSL is a protocol that encrypts data sent over internet/network. SSH has it's own built in encryption.

example:    echo 'hello' | openssl s_client -connect [address:port]




chmod     > Change permissions of a file

-R   > Recrusively


wc	  > Word/line count

-l   > lines
-w   > words
-b   > bytes



awk	  > can print specific columns of txt files.  



command	  > runs original system version of a command, ignoring shell built ins, functions, aliases. (lesser known)
