1. Hardware speaks binary. 10101010
2. Operating systems are like translators. They translate human language to Binary. Like a middle man. 
							SO HOW DOES IT WORK

Repositary = Folder

Let's say I type: ls

The process is as follows:

The OS will look through the $PATH variable for the Binary of the 'ls' command




/  = Root directory

~  = Home Directory

.. = move back 1

.  = Where i currently am



File Permissions

USER	GROUP	OTHERS

r-x	rw-

CONFLICTS!!!
